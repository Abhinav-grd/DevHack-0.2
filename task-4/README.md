# Task-4 - Create a website habit tracker chrome extension.

This will be the final task of DevHack-0.2.

Your task is create a chrome extension, which can keep a track of the "number of times you visited a particular website" in the last few days. 

### UI requirements
The basic requiements of UI will be a 'text field' and a 'button'. In the text field, you will enter the URL of the website (Eg: https://github.com) and on clicking the button, it will show the number of times you visited that particular website in last few days (say a month). You can set any time duration more than 1 week.

<b>Note: It should not use any server i.e it should be decentralised.</b>

If you feel any confusion regarding this task, feel free to contact any of the coordinators.

There are couple of resources available on the internet on "How to create a chrome extension".

<h3><b>Deadline: 14th April, 2019</b></h3>

After this task the final leaderboard will be published as soon as possible. :)
