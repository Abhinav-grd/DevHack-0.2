Ever wondered how Aurora (Coding Judge) is hosted on the LAN of BIT Mesra? The simple answer is "It is a website that is hosted using a [web server](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Web-server)". Two of the most popular web server softwares are [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) and [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/). 

Your task is to create a very simple web page (using html) and host that on LAN using Nginx or Apache. The web page should be accessible through your computer IP over LAN.

 The web page should contains the following things:
Your Team Name
The name of your team members with their details (Roll Number and GitHub URL).

<h3><b>Resources:</b></h3>
