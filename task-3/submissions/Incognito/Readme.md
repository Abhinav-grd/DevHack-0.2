<h2>Online browser based text editor</h2>

This web app can be used to create and edit documents using features like bullets, bold, italic, font_color etc.
User can save the document in the browser's local storage(browser cookies) and can edit it later. 

<h2>How it works ?</h2>
It creates an iframe in the html document and you will be using that area to edit your documents.
Whenever you click a button and make a change the html content of the iframe is appended with the corresponding tag, 
thus making oyur changes visible in the working area.
