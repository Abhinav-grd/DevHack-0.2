### Approach

We have used HTML5 and Javascript functions for editting the text entered into the text area.
We have given it a feel of MS Word with various buttons to edit text, add color and also insert image. I have used iframe for rich text field. The buttons have been included by the use of fontawesome icons. Whenever a desired button is clicked a javascript function is called depending the desired function and the function executed the desired function.
