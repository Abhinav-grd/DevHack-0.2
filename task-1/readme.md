Ever wondered how Aurora (Coding Judge) is hosted on the LAN of BIT Mesra? The simple answer is "It is a website that is hosted using a [web server](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Web-server)". Two of the most popular web server softwares are [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) and [Apache](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/apache/). 

Your task is to create a very simple web page (using html) and host that on LAN using Nginx or Apache. The web page should be accessible through your computer IP over LAN.

 <h3>The web page should contain the following things:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Your Team Name
<li> The name of your team members with their details (Roll Number and GitHub URL).
</ul>
<h3><b>Resources:</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk">Learn HTML in 12 minutes</a></li>
  <li>https://nginx.org/en/</li>
